@node Introduction
@chapter Introduction

BBDB, which stands for Insidious Big Brother Database is an address
book and contact management module for Emacs. BBDB can be integrated
into mail and news readers, chat clients and other modules within
Emacs. If you use BBDB to keep track of contact information, you'll be
able to look up phone numbers or notes to people's records from your
Emacs-based mail or from your org-mode documents. Even if you use bbdb
simply as as a basic address book, you'll find that BBDB's
customizability makes it surprisingly powerful.

@node Via package manager
@section Via package manager

The easiest way to install BBDB is via the builtin package manager.
@uref{http://melpa.milkbox.net/,MELPA} contains very up-to-date packages for BBDB.

@enumerate
@item
Add MELPA as a package archive @uref{http://melpa.org/#/getting-started}
@item
@kbd{M-x package-install @key{RET} bbdb @key{RET}}
@end enumerate

@node From Source
@section From Source

To build BBDB from source you will have to get it from
@uref{http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/bbdb/}. Check it out using git:

@example
git clone git://git.savannah.nongnu.org/bbdb.git
@end example

Then build it using the usual magic incantations:

@example
cd bbdb
./autogen.sh
configure
make elpa
@end example

Then inside your Emacs install the package you just built using
@kbd{M-x package-install-file}.

For more advanced options see the @verb{~README~} that comes with the source
distribution of BBDB.

@node Adding contacts
@chapter Adding contacts

When you start bbdb for the first time with @kbd{M-x bbdb @key{RET}}
you will have an empty address book. To add a contact type
@kbd{c} in the @verb{~*BBDB*~} buffer. This will prompt for a name and
several fields. You can then fill in the information or just hit
@kbd{@key{RET}} when the corresponding field is empty. When asked
for labels such as phone or address labels @kbd{@key{TAB}} will
give you a completion list of existing labels.

@verbatim
Alyssa P. Hacker - MIT

                     Cambridge, MA 02139
                     United States

@chapter Editing records

Say you realize that you forgot to add a URL to your contact Alyssa P.
Hacker. So you go to your contact @kbd{M-x bbdb @key{RET} Alyssa @key{RET}}
and type @kbd{i}. You will be prompted by a field name. Again
@kbd{@key{TAB}} will give you a completion list of existing
fields. Pick @verb{~url~} and enter the URL. You will end up with the
following entry:

@verbatim
Alyssa P. Hacker - MIT
     address (work): 77 Massachusetts Ave
                     Cambridge, MA 02139
